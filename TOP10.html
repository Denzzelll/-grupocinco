Phanaeng curry is a variety of Thai curry that is characterized by a thick texture and salty-sweet peanut flavor. It consists of meat that is stewed with coconut milk, panang curry paste, makrut lime leaves, fish sauce, and palm sugar. The meat used in phanaeng curry is usually beef, chicken, duck, or pork, and the dish traditionally does not include any vegetables.
<br>
<br>
The name of the dish is derived from the word panang, meaning cross, which refers to the ancient way of preparing chicken with its legs crossed and set in an upright position. Though the origins of phanaeng curry are somewhat murky, it is often associated with the Malaysian state of Penang, but there is little evidence to support this claim.
<br>
<br>
However, the earliest known recipe is found in Maawm Sohm Jeenâ€™s book Tam Raa Gap Khao, dating back to 1890. Once finished, the curry is garnished with thinly sliced makrut lime leaves and Thai spur chili slices, and a bit of coconut milk can be poured over the curry.
