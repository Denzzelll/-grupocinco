Pappardelle is a famous Tuscan pasta variety. When paired with ragù di cinghiale (made with wild boar), they become one of the region's best gastronomic experiences. Unlike classic ragù, the one prepared with wild boar has an intense, much stronger flavor achieved by long, slow simmering in a rich sauce of tomatoes and red wine.

The tender meat paired with fresh egg pasta is a combination full of flavors and tradition in every single bite - rich and delicious, topped with a generous amount of chopped fresh parsley and a sprinkle of Parmigiano, pappardelle al ragù di cinghiale make a perfect, comforting winter dish, especially when paired with a glass of Tuscan red wine.
