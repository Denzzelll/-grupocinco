Named after the 19th-century poet Raimundo António de Bulhão Pato, this simple Portuguese dish combines clams and a flavorful sauce that is based on olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, and fresh cilantro. However, the sauce can also have white wine as one of its ingredients. Bulhão Pato clams are typically enjoyed as an appetizer and are usually served with bread on the side.
