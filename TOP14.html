Bánh mì thịt is a traditional Vietnamese bánh mì sandwich variation in which thịt means meat. As the name suggests, the sandwich is made with various Vietnamese cold cuts such as sliced roasted pork, sliced pork belly, chả (sliced ham), or chả lụa pork sausage, along with cucumbers, mayonnaise, pickled carrots and daikon, and liver pâté stuffed into a bánh mì roll.

The sandwich is often garnished with ingredients such as coriander, black pepper, and sliced chili peppers. These meat-filled sandwiches are common throughout Vietnam and they’re a staple of school children and factory workers. Bánh mì thịt is usually enjoyed for breakfast and lunch, but the sandwiches can be eaten for any meal of the day if bought from street stall vendors.
