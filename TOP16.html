<p class="size">
Rich, substantial, and tropically flavored - vatapá is one of the most famous Brazilian dishes, a main course consisting of a combination of stale bread, fish (usually cod), shrimp, coconut milk, manioc flour, dendê palm oil, and cashews.
<br>
<br>
The dish is often consumed with white rice, or as a filling for acarajé fritters, another popular Brazilian dish. Bright yellow in color, vatapá is a specialty of Bahia, a state on the country's northeastern coast that is heavily influenced by the West Africans who were brought to the country as slaves.
<br>
<br>
Although the origins of this dish are unknown, most culinary historians agree that it was invented in Bahia, even if the basic concept for the dish came from Africa.
