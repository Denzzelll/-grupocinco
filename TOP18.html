Leche de tigre is a Peruvian specialty consisting of ceviche juice that is left after the fish has been consumed. The milky liquid is sometimes made on its own with fish stock. There are numerous variations of leche de tigre, but each drink is characterized by its blend of numerous flavors: spicy, acidic, savory, creamy, and fresh.
<br>
<br>
Some cooks like to make the drink more creamy by adding pur√©ed fish into it, while others like to add milk in order to balance the acidity coming from the lime juice. Leche de tigre has a special place in most Peruvian households since it is considered an aphrodisiac and a great hangover cure.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes, the drink is mixed with coconut milk, vodka, and white wine for the creation of a unique cocktail.
