Roti canai is a traditional pan-fried flatbread made with flour, water, eggs, and fat of Indian origin, but mainly associated with Malaysia, and surrounding countries like Indonesia, Brunei, and Thailand.
<br>
<br>
The dough for roti canai is repeatedly folded, so the final product has a layered texture, a soft interior, and a crispy outer layer. The most common fat used in roti canai is ghee, the traditional Indian clarified butter. It is believed that the dish originated in India when the Indian laborers who migrated to Malaysia brought the recipe and the tradition of preparing this crispy pastry to the foreign country.
<br>
<br>
Usually, it is served plain in its traditional round form, as an accompaniment to curries. It can be served on the side or torn into pieces and mixed with the curry. However, roti canai is often served as the star dish, accompanied by different savory and sweet fillings and ingredients.
<br>
<br>
If additional fillings are added, roti canai is usually shaped into rectangles. For example, in Malaysia, one can find various roti canai types, which are differentiated by the type of filling â€” egg, onion, egg and onion, banana, sardines, margarine and sugar, Maggi instant noodles, cheese, vegetable, and pork filling are some of the many available.
<br>
<br>
However, roti canai doesn't have to have a filling but only a topping, such as fried eggs, curry, beans, lentils, and coffee beans. But martabak, a thick roti filled with meats, eggs, onions, and spices, is probably the best-known type of roti canai.
<br>
<br>
Apart from Malaysia, it can also be found in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and a few other countries. Other than Malaysia, a very similar type of flatbread can be found in Singapore, where it's called roti prata. This crispy bread is usually sold by street vendors called mamaks.</p>
