<p class="size">
Chilaquiles are, at their most basic, an assembly of fried tortilla pieces drenched in chili sauce with optional meat and vegetables.
<br>
<br>
The dish is popular both in Mexico and the United States as a great way to use up leftover, stale tortillas. The name of the dish is derived from chil-a-quilitl, meaning greens or herbs in a chili broth.
<br>
<br>
Today, there is a great number of regional variations of the dish, so in Sinaloa it is prepared with a white sauce, and in Mexico City, the dish is traditionally topped with epazote sprigs.</p>
