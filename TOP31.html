This delectable cheese-filled focaccia hails from the town of Recco, Liguria's gastronomic capital where it can be found in every bakery, pizzeria, and restaurant. It was reportedly invented in the 12th century when, according to legend, the citizens of Recco were preparing this dish for the Crusaders with the little they had: flour, water, olive oil, and some cheese.
<br>
<br>
Unlike most other focaccia flatbreads, this one is made without yeast, and features a paper-thin, hand-pulled crust filled with the soft, mild-flavored cowâ€™s milk cheese from Alpine pastures called stracchino or crescenza. By the end of the 1800s, focaccia di Recco had become traditionally associated with the celebration of All Saints' Day, but today it is prepared and enjoyed throughout the year.
<br>
<br>
Moreover, ever since 1955, the town of Recco has been hosting the so-called Festa della Focaccia, an annual festival held every last week of May.</p>
