Ciorba Radauteana is a traditional Romanian soup. It's made with a combination of chicken, onions, sweet red pepper, celery, carrots, lemon juice, garlic, parsley, and sour cream. 
<br>
<br>
The ingredients are simmered over medium heat until the meat and the vegetables become tender.
<br>
<br>
The soup is quite sour due to the addition of lemon juice. In Romania, ciorba Radauteana is especially prized for being a hangover cure and having healing properties - it's often used as a remedy for common cold symptoms.
