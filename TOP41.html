	<h1>Roast Suckling Pig (Siu yuk)</h1>

A version of typical Cantonese siu mei (roasted meat dishes), siu yuk is a hefty meal that is mostly consumed in small quantities, made by roasting a whole, seasoned pig in charcoal furnaces at very high temperatures, resulting in succulent, tender meat and crispy skin.
<br>
<br>
Traditionally, the meat is served as it is, but it is sometimes accompanied by either hoisin sauce or soy sauce. Since it is a known fact that the Chinese have many beliefs, in Hong Kong siu yuk is often oferred to the Jade Emperor (the first god in Chinese culture) in order to celebrate a movie's opening, hoping that the movie achieves great success in the cinemas.
<br>
<br>
The dish is often garnished with pineapple or cucumber slices, placed in a red box and wrapped with red wrapping paper, for additional luck.
