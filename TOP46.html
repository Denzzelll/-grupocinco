Japanese-style curry known as karē is one of the most popular dishes in the country. It started gaining popularity in Japan during the Meiji period (1868-1912), when the British introduced it to the country. During its early years, karē with rice was an expensive, gourmet dish reserved only for the wealthy.
<br>
<br>
Compared to Indian curries, karē is less spicy, sweeter, darker, and usually thicker, which is thanks to the addition of flour or roux. There are three main version of karē in Japan - karē raisu (curry over rice), karē udon (curry over noodles), and karē -pan (a pastry filled with curry).
<br>
<br>
The most popular variety, is, as expected, karē raisu, which is usually served with fukujinzuke pickles or Japanese scallions on the side. Today, karē is so popular in Japan that it can be called a true national dish.
