Indian tikka is a dish consisting of boneless meat, usually chicken, that is cut into smaller pieces and marinated in yogurt and traditional Indian spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper, chili, garlic, and ginger. The meat is roasted over charcoal in a tandoor, the traditional cylindrical clay oven.
<br>
<br>
To remain tender and juicy, the meat is repeatedly brushed with oil or butter. Tikka is typically cooked and served on sizzlers, but the plain varieties are also common. It is often wrongly associated with tandoori chicken, a variety baked and served with the meat left on the bone.
<br>
<br>
In chicken tikka masala the meat is served with tomato sauce and is considered one of British national dishes. Tikka is usually accompanied by onions, chopped coriander, vegetable chutney, and lemon slices.
