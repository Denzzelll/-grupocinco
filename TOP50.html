In Czech folklore, the best cure for a cold or a hangover is a bowl of česnečka, a traditional garlic soup.
<br>
<br>
Although garlic is the key ingredient, the soup also incorporates potatoes, meat broth, onions, and traditional spices such as caraway and marjoram.
<br>
<br>
This healthy dish is usually topped with grated cheese and crunchy croutons, and it is commonly served and enjoyed as an appetizer.
