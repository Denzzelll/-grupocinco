Butter garlic naan is a traditional Indian flatbread and one of the most popular versions of naan. It’s made with flour, yeast, salt, sugar, and yogurt. Once the dough has been baked in a hot tandoor oven, the golden naan is taken out and brushed with butter or ghee, then topped with minced garlic.
