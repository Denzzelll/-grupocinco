Shashlik is the name for a traditional Central and West Asian barbecue consisting of marinated, skewered, and grilled chunks of meat such as lamb, beef, or pork, depending on regional and religious preferences. Lamb, beef, or pork is usually combined with chunks of vegetables such as bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, or tomatoes.
<br>
<br>
The meat is typically marinated overnight in vinegar, herbs, spices, and dry wine. In Russia, barbecue is traditionally reserved for men, who are in charge of the whole grilling process, while the women are usually busy slicing vegetables and setting the tables.
<br>
<br>
Shashlik is traditionally prepared for events with a large number of people gathered around the fire, cooperating and socializing in the process, making the dish a communal affair. Because the origins of the dish lie between Turkey and Russia, many believe that the name is derived from the Turkish word shish, meaning skewer.
<br>
<br>
In Georgia, shashlik is known as mtsvadi.
